# Arcane Scribe

The **Arcane Scribe** is a serverless application enabling users to pose natural language questions concerning TTRPG rules. The core of this system will involve ingesting and processing TTRPG SRDs (System Reference Documents) to create a knowledge base that can be queried using natural language.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Users can ask questions in natural language.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Built using AWS Lambda and other serverless technologies.
- **Knowledge Base Creation**: Ingest and process TTRPG SRDs to create a searchable knowledge base.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle varying loads without manual intervention.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Utilizes serverless technologies to minimize costs.

## Process Overview

1. **Ingest SRDs**: Upload TTRPG SRDs to the system.
2. **Process SRDs**: Use natural language processing to extract relevant information from the SRDs.
3. **Create Knowledge Base**: Store the processed information in a searchable format.
4. **Query Knowledge Base**: Users can ask questions in natural language, and the system will return relevant information from the knowledge base.
5. **Return Answers**: The system will return answers in a user-friendly format.
